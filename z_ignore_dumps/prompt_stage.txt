You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of

optimization, backend data structures and algorithms, and security.

Reference:
Create a module for guest page.

Instructions:
Guest page should give the user the glimpse of the browse without showing the full information of the bidder and without the bidding system and as well as the q&A
Guest page must have 2 tabs: browse tab and the account tab (user can check if their account is already approved by the admin or not. basically the account status. handle this completely and professionally.)
make sure this is directly accessibly on the login page.

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- every single component must be responsive for darkmode
