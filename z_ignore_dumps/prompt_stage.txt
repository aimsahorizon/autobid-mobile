Instructions:
- Focus on lib/auth/<registration_files> AND related files in lib/app
- Update the registration feature in auth module with the following guidelines:
-- It has to have 9 step KYC process:
1. Philippine National ID -> ID Number, Front ID Photo, Back ID Photo
2. Selfie with National ID with instructions: Hold next to face, visibility, readability, lighting condition, remove glasses if possible (expound these instructions)
3. Secondary Philippines Government ID -> ID NUmber, Front ID Photo, Back ID Photo
Note: After step 2, there should be a dialog prompting user to auto fill out the rest of information that is available and taken from ID scan using AI text recognition model to extract data from ID.

4. Personal Information - Firstname, Middlename, Lastname, Date of Birth, Sex
5. Account Information - email, phone number (PH +63), password, confirm password, accept and read terms and condition, accept and read privacy policy
6. 2 Step 6 Digit OTP verification of (1) Phone -> (2) Email
7. Address Information - Dynamically Filtered Philippine: Region, Province, City/Municipality, Barangay, Street Address, ZIP Code
8. Proof of Address Validation - Certain documents to prove one's address is valid - upload document
9. Review all information - user can go back to every step and edit their details

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Minor Notes:
- Use the design theme from lib/app/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- Handle Professionally and Robust

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
