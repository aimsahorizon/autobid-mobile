You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI UX design principles, 
optimization, backend data structures and algorithms, and security.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Instructions:
* Focus on lib/modules/lists and all related files under lib/app.
* Implement the full transaction pre-transaction discussion system. (Under lists module, under in transaction sub tabs upon clicking each cards)
* Implement the complete 9-step “Create New Listing” flow with proper structure, mock data handling, form validation, and draft-saving logic.

Reference:
* Pre-transaction flow phases:
  discussion phase -> review both forms -> both confirmed -> submitted to admin -> approved? -> pretransaction becomes immutable -> deposit refunded/credited -> seller proceeds with transaction -> buyer monitors -> transaction complete -> platform & buyer review.

Tasks:
Note: Do Mockups, but prepare this for supabase integration, make sure it is easily switchable for actual backend.
* For the transaction module, create a card-triggered pre-transaction discussion page with 4 subtabs: chat, my form, buyer form, progress.
* Chat: build a basic but clean messaging interface for buyers and sellers to discuss form details.
* My Form: implement structured inputs for all required pre-transaction agreements and legal checklist items.
* Buyer Form: allow seller to review the submitted buyer form; include states for pending, reviewed, changes requested, confirmed.
* Progress: show transaction timeline updates by system and seller, reflecting the pre-transaction → admin review → approval → ongoing → completion.
* Ensure the entire pre-transaction pipeline is logically connected and the UI clearly guides the user.

Next: Build the 9-step Create Listing Form:
  1. Basic Information: Brand, Model, Variant, Year
  2. Mechanical Specification: engine details, transmission, fuel, drive type, etc.
  3. Dimensions & Capacity: full measurement and weight fields
  4. Exterior Details: color, paint type, rims, tires
  5. Condition & History: condition, mileage, owners, modifications, warranty, usage
  6. Documentation & Location: plate, OR/CR, registration status & expiry, province, city/municipality
  7. Photos: handle all 56 required image categories with dynamic list and status indicators
  8. Final Details: description (min 50 chars), known issues, car features
  9. Listing Summary: review each step, allow editing, support saving drafts in every step
* After submission, create a modal dialog: “Listing Submitted!” with options (create another / view my listing).
Listing should go in pending tab upon submission. prepare the backend integration but do the mock up for now.

Reference:
Focus on lib/modules/bids and related files in lib/app

Context:
- I want to implement the details of each cards in bids module, let's handle this professionally.
- Prepare a mock data for each of the card details in the 3 sub tabs under bids module, but make sure to prepare it for backend supabase integration

Tasks:
- for Active tab: this is exactly similar to browse auction detail, but it needs to be independent from it, and needs to have the deposits unlock already and the user is currently bidding.
- for Won tab: this is typically similar to the "In transaction" in lists module, except that it has to be for the buyer. create and independent component for this, you may use the pre transaction as reference but the sub tabs has to be correct (chat, my form, seller's form, progress tracker)
- Lost Tab: basically shows the ended auction from browse, where it is no longer active. the user has lost but can see the remaining information that is accessible aside from the bidding.

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
