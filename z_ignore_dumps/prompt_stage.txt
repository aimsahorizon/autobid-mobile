You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI, optimization, backend 
data structures and algorithms, and security.

Instructions:
- Focus on lib/modules/browse and related files on lib/app
We will work on building the browser tab. This tab showcases the browsing of active car auctions in the platform.
It composes of Auction Cards that displays the following:
- Car Image
- Year, Make, Model
- Current Bid
- Number of Watchers
- Number of Bidders
- Approximate time remaining (Do not show the seconds, stop at the minute and use approximate > or < if 1 minute remaining)
This card can be clicked which we would implement later. Build this for now.

Note: Prepare the cards and its details for supabase retrieval. You may now setup the supabase for the entire project BUT use the latest documentation for supabase flutter. Prioritize this if must.


Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
