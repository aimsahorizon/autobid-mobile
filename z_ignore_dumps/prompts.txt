IMPLEMENT FEATURE:

Implementation Prompt

You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI, optimization, backend 
data structures and algorithms, and security.

Instruction:
Prepare the 4 different user logged-in Modules in the following order and guideline:
Module 1: Browse Tab
Module 2: Bids Tab
Module 3: Lists Tab
Module 4: Profile Tab
- Prepare only the pages with bottom navigation bar
- Do not create any UI yet, just the text indicating the page
- prepare the rest of the folders and possible needed files but keep them empty

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Minor Notes:
- focus on frontend, but prepare the code for backend with supabase
- prepare UI for light and dark mode

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
