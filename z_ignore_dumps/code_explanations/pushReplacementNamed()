## How `pushReplacementNamed()` Works

**The referenced line:**
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed(AuthRoutes.login);
```

### The Three-Part System:

1. **Route Constants** (`AuthRoutes` class):
   - Defines named route strings like `login = '/login'`
   - These are just string constants that act as identifiers

2. **Route Handler** (`AppRouter.onGenerateRoute`):
   - Configured in your `MaterialApp` via the `onGenerateRoute` parameter
   - This callback intercepts navigation requests whenever `pushReplacementNamed()` is called
   - It examines the route name and returns the appropriate `MaterialPageRoute` with the correct widget

3. **Navigation Call**:
   - `pushReplacementNamed(AuthRoutes.login)` passes the string `/login` to the Navigator
   - The Navigator calls `onGenerateRoute()` with `RouteSettings(name: '/login')`
   - The router's switch statement matches the name and builds the corresponding page

### The Flow:

```
pushReplacementNamed(AuthRoutes.login)
         ↓
   passes "/login"
         ↓
   onGenerateRoute() receives RouteSettings
         ↓
   switch(settings.name) matches case AuthRoutes.login
         ↓
   Returns MaterialPageRoute(builder: LoginPage(...))
         ↓
   LoginPage is displayed, replacing the previous route
```

**Key benefit**: You don't need to manually create routes—Flutter's 
Navigator system automatically handles finding and building the right page 
based on the route name. The `onGenerateRoute` callback acts as a central 
registry that maps route names to their widgets.
