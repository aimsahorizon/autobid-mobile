Reference:
Focus on lib/modules/bids and related files in lib/app

Context:
- It seems that it only shows "Transaction not found" upon clicking the cards in pre transaction. I understand this doesn't have backend, but make sure the backend is ready only, and the mock implementation actually works temporarily to visualize the UI.

Tasks:
- identify and find a solution to make a temporary workaround work the pre transaction without changing the preparation for backend.
- make sure it is switchable
- Apply this as well for drafts and in cancelled->re-edit sub tabs.

You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI UX design principles, 
optimization, backend data structures and algorithms, and security.

Reference:
- Focus on lib/modules/lists and all related files under lib/app.

Context:
We recently made a 9 step process for creating a new listings for the car.
Now, using the car details in the 9 steps, we will implement the car details in each of the cards in lists module sub tabs.

Instructions:
- EXCEPT FROM "In transaction" sub tabs in lists module, make every single one of the cards clickable
- Create an interface for each of the cards, that is relevant to their individual purposes
- Make sure each of the sub tabs card will show information that is correct as per their sub tabs they belong:
Guide:
* Active - Must show similar to browsing page auction detail, but for the seller side where seller can see every single detail in browse, and can especially comment reply to queries. (do not reuse cards from browsing)
* Pending - Create a UI UX friendly interface to show all the car details in the 9 steps, and indicate that it is pending. Some of the cards, must show admin approval and would give options for users to post it live.
* Drafts - Similar to pending somehow, but is editable and would lead to create listing STEP 1
* Sold - Similar to pending but containts the complete details of the pre transaction features
* cancelled - similar to pending but users has the option to edit (if edited resubmit for verification), or directly re-auction the car (in cases of reserved prices not met), or delete.
Note: 
- Handle this professionally, especially the UI UX layout, make sure the details is complete and correct as per the standard of online car auctions and practical practices.
- Make sure each of these cards are independent widgets. they may have similarity but I need a robust setup

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- every single component must be responsive for darkmode

---

You are a Senior Flutter Developer, specialized in robust refactoring, debugging, and editing of existing code system.
You are a master of design principles and understand the programming patterns and problems carefully.

Following the recent updates in create listings, I want you to add autofill demo for every single step to enhance user testing.

Note:
- Make sure this doesn't affect the existing backend codes and business logics.
- Isolate this functionality and make it easily removable.

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI UX design principles, 
optimization, backend data structures and algorithms, and security.

Instructions:
* Focus on lib/modules/lists and all related files under lib/app.
* Implement the full transaction pre-transaction discussion system. (Under lists module, under in transaction sub tabs upon clicking each cards)
* Implement the complete 9-step “Create New Listing” flow with proper structure, mock data handling, form validation, and draft-saving logic.

Reference:
* Pre-transaction flow phases:
  discussion phase -> review both forms -> both confirmed -> submitted to admin -> approved? -> pretransaction becomes immutable -> deposit refunded/credited -> seller proceeds with transaction -> buyer monitors -> transaction complete -> platform & buyer review.

Tasks:
Note: Do Mockups, but prepare this for supabase integration, make sure it is easily switchable for actual backend.
* For the transaction module, create a card-triggered pre-transaction discussion page with 4 subtabs: chat, my form, buyer form, progress.
* Chat: build a basic but clean messaging interface for buyers and sellers to discuss form details.
* My Form: implement structured inputs for all required pre-transaction agreements and legal checklist items.
* Buyer Form: allow seller to review the submitted buyer form; include states for pending, reviewed, changes requested, confirmed.
* Progress: show transaction timeline updates by system and seller, reflecting the pre-transaction → admin review → approval → ongoing → completion.
* Ensure the entire pre-transaction pipeline is logically connected and the UI clearly guides the user.

Next: Build the 9-step Create Listing Form:
  1. Basic Information: Brand, Model, Variant, Year
  2. Mechanical Specification: engine details, transmission, fuel, drive type, etc.
  3. Dimensions & Capacity: full measurement and weight fields
  4. Exterior Details: color, paint type, rims, tires
  5. Condition & History: condition, mileage, owners, modifications, warranty, usage
  6. Documentation & Location: plate, OR/CR, registration status & expiry, province, city/municipality
  7. Photos: handle all 56 required image categories with dynamic list and status indicators
  8. Final Details: description (min 50 chars), known issues, car features
  9. Listing Summary: review each step, allow editing, support saving drafts in every step
* After submission, create a modal dialog: “Listing Submitted!” with options (create another / view my listing).
Listing should go in pending tab upon submission. prepare the backend integration but do the mock up for now.

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

I need the following details for every single card:
1. Car cover photo - with car year, make, model, and auction status
2. Auction Detail Bidding info section - Time remaining (detailed with seconds), Current bid price, Reserve price status (met or not met), Reserve price(either shown or hidden) total number of bids, total number of watchers
3. Car Photos Section - with categories chip (Exterior, Interior, Engine, Details, Documents), and photos shown below based on chip category selected
4. Bidding Card Section - Initially locked and need deposit of 10k before starting to bid, we will use paymongo sandbox for dev that accepts, Gcash, Maya, and Cards
after payment, the following should be displayed:
- Minimum Bid, Bid Amount Input Field, Autofill Bid amounts with chips component. Minimum should be set by the seller. Increments by default should be (minimum, + button for users to add their custom increment chips should be above minimum.)

We will work on building the browser tab. This tab showcases the browsing of active car auctions in the platform.
It composes of Auction Cards that displays the following:
- Car Image
- Year, Make, Model
- Current Bid
- Number of Watchers
- Number of Bidders
- Approximate time remaining (Do not show the seconds, stop at the minute and use approximate > or < if 1 minute remaining)
This card can be clicked which we would implement later. Build this for now.
