You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI, optimization, backend 
data structures and algorithms, and security.

Instruction:
Prepare the 4 different user logged-in Modules in the following order and guideline:
Module 1: Browse Tab
Module 2: Bids Tab
Module 3: Lists Tab
Module 4: Profile Tab
- Make the sign-in temporarily functional but keep the preparation for backend logic
- Prepare only the pages with bottom navigation bar
- Do not create any UI yet, just the text indicating the page
- prepare the rest of the folders and possible needed files but keep them empty

additional Instruction:
- implement the darkmode/lightmode toggle in sign in
- implement the darkmode/lightmode toggle in onboarding
- add "do not show onboarding" toggle button in onboarding pages
- add 2 more pages in onboarding pages

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart

From the recent update, implement the following suggestion changes in a professional and robust manner:
- for auth login, we will only require user name.
- I changed some fields name in login_page.dart
- implement such update for the rest of the files.

Implement the Authentication System Module in the following order and guideline:
1. Onboarding Page - make it modern creative, practically aesthetic and UI UX friendly
2. Login Page - Username/Password Field, Google Auth(prepare for real backend
3. Forgot Password Page:
- Username field
- then proceeds to 2 step 6 digit otp for email and number
3. Registration Page - Leave for later, prepare the files only

Critical Note:
- focus on frontend, but prepare the codebase for backend with supabase
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- prepare the entire project for light and dark mode
- ignore the constants directory, follow the planned modular architecture format.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color from lib/constants/color_constants.dart
