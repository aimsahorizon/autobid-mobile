You are a senior flutter developer with over 30 years of 
experience building enterprise and medium sized professional 
and scalable mobile applications with flutter. You are following 
the best standard and practices for both UI, optimization, backend 
data structures and algorithms, and security.

Instructions:
- Focus on lib/auth/<registration_files> AND related files in lib/app
- Update the registration feature in auth module with the following guidelines:
-- It has to have 9 step KYC process:
1. Philippine National ID -> ID Number, Front ID Photo, Back ID Photo
2. Selfie with National ID with instructions: Hold next to face, visibility, readability, lighting condition, remove glasses if possible (expound these instructions)
3. Secondary Philippines Government ID -> ID NUmber, Front ID Photo, Back ID Photo
Note: After step 2, there should be a dialog prompting user to auto fill out the rest of information that is available and taken from ID scan using AI text recognition model to extract data from ID.

4. Personal Information - Firstname, Middlename, Lastname, Date of Birth, Sex
5. Account Information - email, phone number (PH +63), password, confirm password, accept and read terms and condition, accept and read privacy policy
6. 2 Step 6 Digit OTP verification of (1) Phone -> (2) Email
7. Address Information - Dynamically Filtered Philippine: Region, Province, City/Municipality, Barangay, Street Address, ZIP Code
8. Proof of Address Validation - Certain documents to prove one's address is valid - upload document
9. Review all information - user can go back to every step and edit their details

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.
- add comments to code blocks (except in presentation directory) that explains the every code logics for beginners

Development Notes:
Break down the presentation UI files into small chunks, do not create lengthy files:
- DRY principle - no code duplication
- Single responsibility - each widget does one thing
- Easy maintenance - change once, affects all
- Testable - widgets can be tested independently
- Scalable - new pages can reuse components

Minor Notes:
- Use the design theme from lib/app/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- Handle Professionally and Robust

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color theme from lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart

Instruction:
Prepare the 4 different user logged-in Modules in the following order and guideline:
Module 1: Browse Tab
Module 2: Bids Tab
Module 3: Lists Tab
Module 4: Profile Tab
- Make the sign-in temporarily functional but keep the preparation for backend logic
- Prepare only the pages with bottom navigation bar
- Do not create any UI yet, just the text indicating the page
- prepare the rest of the folders and possible needed files but keep them empty

additional Instruction:
- implement the darkmode/lightmode toggle in sign in
- implement the darkmode/lightmode toggle in onboarding
- add "do not show onboarding" toggle button in onboarding pages
- add 2 more pages in onboarding pages

Critical Note:
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.

From the recent update, implement the following suggestion changes in a professional and robust manner:
- for auth login, we will only require user name.
- I changed some fields name in login_page.dart
- implement such update for the rest of the files.

Implement the Authentication System Module in the following order and guideline:
1. Onboarding Page - make it modern creative, practically aesthetic and UI UX friendly
2. Login Page - Username/Password Field, Google Auth(prepare for real backend
3. Forgot Password Page:
- Username field
- then proceeds to 2 step 6 digit otp for email and number
3. Registration Page - Leave for later, prepare the files only

Critical Note:
- focus on frontend, but prepare the codebase for backend with supabase
- do not use super complex code, use only between junior to senior proficiency.
- prepare the entire project for light and dark mode
- ignore the constants directory, follow the planned modular architecture format.
- do not over explain after output, only 1-3 line feedbacks.
- do not create unnecessary readme or docs files.

Design Preference:
- Minimal, clean, modern, with soft colors, rounded corners, and spacing.
- use the color from lib/constants/color_constants.dart
