"Hi, I'm trying to upload my proof of payment for auction auct_789, but I keep getting an error message 'File too large'. I tried compressing the image but it still won't upload. Please help!"

[12:30] Admin Juan (Support):
"Hello Maria, thank you for reaching out. I can see the issue. Our system has a 5MB file size limit. Can you try compressing your image to under 5MB? You can use tools like TinyPNG or reduce the image resolution. Let me know if you need further assistance."

"I already tried that, it's still not working. Can you check if there's a technical issue?"
